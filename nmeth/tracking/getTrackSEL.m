%                              = number of track segments in compound
%                              track. Number of columns = 8 * number of 
%                              frames the compound track spans. Each row
%                              consists of

%                              NaN indicates frames where track segments do

%                              of events happening in a track and 4

%                              2nd: 1 - start of track, 2 - end of track;
%                              3rd: Index of track segment that ends or starts;
%                              4th: NaN - start is a birth and end is a death,
%                                   number - start is due to a split, end
%                                   is due to a merge, number is the index
%                                   of track segment for the merge/split.

%OUTPUT trackSEL          : An array with 3 columns and number of rows equal
%                           to number of (compound) tracks. 1st column 
%                           indicates track start times, 2nd column
%                           indicates track end times and 3rd column
%                           indicates track lifetimes.

%REMARKS The details of compound tracks are currently ignored. The start
%times, end time and life times are for the overall compound tracks, not
